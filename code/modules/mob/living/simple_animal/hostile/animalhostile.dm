/*Common East Coast hostile critters -Pebbles
- Ghoul Rotter		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ghoulrotter
	Just trying to make a new ghoul sprite thats less ass
- Skolf				/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/skolf
	Packs, pretty deadly to lightly armored people, dont place in low threat areas. Sort of glass cannons?

Uncommon critters
- Yao Guai 			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/yaoguai
	Really tough beast packing a punch. Must be dangerous to PA people.
- Aradnid			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/aradnid
	Injects rads. Only map near toxic sites.
- Scolopendra		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/scolopendra
	Tunnel critter, very fast, modest brute, high toxin damage, decently tough. Supposed to make narrow tunnels scary.

Stuff not supposed to be in East coast (to differentiate, give flavour. Less is more. Don't listen to Bethesda.)
- Cazador
- Feral dog (Coyotes)
- Geckos
- Nightstalkers

General thoughts: More traits possible to add? Like resists to energy weapons/ballistics? Armor so AP is useful? Ability
to produce smoke or slow down victims? Stuff like that added to a couple would be fun.
