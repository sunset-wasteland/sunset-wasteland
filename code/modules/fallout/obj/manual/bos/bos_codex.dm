	<h3>Mankinds hubris and knowledge outpaced their wisdom. Gather and keep safe the fragments of this knowledge, for an age when wiser men might inherit them, and wipe clean those mistakes which plague the world still, that they who walk the earth may flourish.</h3>
	<p>The Brotherhoods chief goal is to seek out, acquire, and preserve advanced technology. Though they focus primarily on fusion-powered weaponry, such as Power Armor and Micro Fusion Cells, as well as the weapons that require them, the Brotherhood could feasibly get involved with any suitably dangerous pre-war technology.</p>
	<p>That being said, the Brotherhood doesnt have time for smaller-scale infractions, such as a wastelander with energy weaponry, Their time is better spent handling the big picture, not chasing insignificant leads.</p>
	<p>What this means is simple: If a wastelander is producing and selling or stockpiling MFC weaponry, or if a regiment of a faction is using primarily MFC weaponry, THEN it is the Brotherhoods duty to get involved. </p>
	<p>Power Armor is a greyer area. Each Castellan or Knight-Commander may take a different stance to the issue, but it is to be handled very delicately: If the group in question is capable of reproducing the armor, or is willing to destroy it, the commanding officer is encouraged to take action, but may deem it unnecessary or unwise to do so in the right circumstances.</p>
	<p>The exception is Forced Evolutionary Virus. If someone is producing, hoarding, or utilizing FEV, it is your duty to neutralize the threat by any and all means necessary, no matter how minor. There is no room for compromise.</p>
	<h3>Be cautious around those who do not pledge to the Brotherhood for though their eyes may be opened through service, they are now blind, though the blind may be shepherded by the wise.</h3>
	<p>Dont bring outsiders into the castle unless they are Wastelander recruits, fairly simple. This can be suspended for diplomatic reasons at the behest of a Knight-Commander or higher, provided there is suitable cause for it. </p>
	<p>In addition, while you should be distrustful of outsiders, they may earn your trust as well. Developing a network of trustworthy contacts and informants is encouraged, as long as they are handled with caution and tact, and not excessively relied on.</p>
	<h3Through discourse, we gain the strength of our Brothers minds. Question orders if you must, and refuse them only if they violate these tenets.</h3>
	<p>If you are given an order you believe will harm the Brotherhoods mission, you are allowed to question it. If the order would violate the Codex, you may refuse to carry it out until it is interpreted otherwise by the Baron. </p>
	<h3>Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Liege. Where he shows trust, so shall you.</h3>
	<p>Barons are the interpreters of the Codex. If they deem an action harmful to the mission, you must not take that action. If they deem that an action must be taken or it will emperil the Brotherhood, you must carry it out. </p>
	<h3>Deceit and lies of all ilk serve only to harm our mission, for your word is your mightiest weapon. Only if the blind are impervious to our wisdom may you strike them down, else you should convince them to serve our purpose.</h3>
	<p>Dont immediately resort to violence to get what you want. Its often most efficient to negotiate a trade, manipulate the outsider, or rely on intimidation, rather than outright violence. Do not turn against a negotiated deal or treaty, as a member of the Brotherhood your honor is one of your most important tenants.</p>
	<h3>Your honor is loyalty, you will follow your leader and your leader will lead you, but follow them not into dishonor.</h3>
	<p>Largely self-explanatory. A leader who breaks from the Codex breaks from loyalty to the station above their own, and so too do those who follow their orders dishonor themselves. Should this occur, its acceptable to break from command and depose the dishonorable leader, but ONLY IF their actions break the Codex in a major and objective way.</p>
	<h3>The orders of the blind hold no weight, but if one of our own is in immediate peril at their hands, demands should be met for the life of your kindred, and aggression must be tempered for the sake of order.</h3>
	<p>If a member of the Brotherhood is held hostage, make every possible effort to recover them unharmed. Revenge can wait until your kindred are safe.</p>
	<h3>Unjust violence is for lesser men. Every act of aggression must serve a clear purpose, and must not compromise the mission of our order. Retribution may be harsh and unseemly to some, but must also be measured and weighed tactfully.</h3>
	<p>The Brotherhoods justice can be harsh and far-reaching. You are not here to make friends, but you are also not here to make yourself a target for the entire wasteland. Try not to resort to torture or mutilation unless ABSOLUTELY necessary, and if deemed so, perform it with utmost secrecy and tact.</p>
