	Greetings, esteemed guest, to NanoTrasen's regional flagship research center. As you may know, \
	this facility is devoted to our theoric microfusion research, enhancing the technology employed \
	in microfusion cells to create an incredible array of new applications and opportunities. <br>\
	This outpost was founded on November 6th 2063 thanks to a generous collaboration with Nuka Cola! \
	NanoTrasen wants to put all the power a house needs for a day, in the palm of your hand. This is an \
	ambitious goal, but we are sworn to accomplish it and go even further, beyond your wildest dreams...\
	The future is now!<br>"

	<b>To: Rolf Ingram, XCC-P5831 Quartermaster</b><br>\
	Hey, Rolf, once you pack that gateway into the ferry hangar, <i>make absolutely sure</i> \
	to deactivate it! As you may know, SS13 has recently got its network up and running, \
	which means that until we get this gate shipped off to the next colonization staging \
	area, they'll be able to hop straight in here if its hooked up on our end.<br>\
	Obviously, that's something I'd very much rather avoid. Our forensics and medical \
	teams never did figure out what happened that last time... and I can't wrap my head \
	around it myself. Why would a shuttle full of evacuees all snap and beat each other \
	to death the moment they reached safety?<br>\
	- D. Cereza"
