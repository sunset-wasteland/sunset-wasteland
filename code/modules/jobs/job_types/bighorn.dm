Town access doors

Barkeep : 28 ACCESS_KITCHEN - you jebronis made default bar for no reason bruh
Banker : 48 ACCESS_MINING
Mayor : 4 ACCESS_FORENSICS_LOCKERS
here's a tip, go search DEFINES/access.dm

Slowly fixing town access because FUCK, someone handed the BoS Bar/Kitchen access which gives them free access to General Town and Bighorn's bar.
General Access : 136 ACCESS_TOWN
Barkeep : 137 ACCESS_TOWN_BAR
Reactor : 138 ACCESS_FUSION
Shopkeeper : 139 ACCESS_SHOPKEEP
Banker Shutters? : 52 ACCESS_MINT_VAULT

Will probably start phasing more of this to actual custom access as we go.
