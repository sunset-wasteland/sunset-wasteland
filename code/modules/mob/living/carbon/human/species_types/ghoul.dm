//ghouls-heal from radiation, do not breathe. do not go into crit. terrible at melee, easily dismembered.
//cannot use medical chemicals to heal brute or burn, must heal from rads, sutures. can use antitoxin chemicals.  //actually changed my mind i'll give stims reduced effect instead
//Slower than humans at combat armor speed, appear dead. rotted organs unable to use for transplant.
//like before, they cannot take piercing wounds or burn wounds or slash wounds, but they can have their bones broken by any source of wound now instead of being impervious
